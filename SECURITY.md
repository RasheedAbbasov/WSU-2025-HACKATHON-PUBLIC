The main concern of security for our web application is the security of our API key. 
One way that we would be able to fix this in the near future would be to explore encryption methods
or utilize environmental variables. Another concern could be the security risks of user's prompt requests.
Once again, this could use further research on ecryption methods to allow for a secure communication of server and user!
